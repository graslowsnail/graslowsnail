# Hi!

I'm a Software Engineer who builds—from cars to art to code. I thrive in fast-paced environments, quickly learn new tech, and adapt to different problem sets.

## Interests
I build across disciplines not just software. In my free time, I dive into:
- **1967 Camaro** — restoring, and learning the craft of old-school performance
- **Weight lifting** — strength, powerlifting, and chasing hard numbers
- **Photography** — capturing moments (Film photography)
- **Analog tech** — modding iPods, vinyl records, making old things feel new
